            <h1 class="gradient-text">Creating experiences that matter</h1>
            <p class="lead">I've always believed that great experiences, whether in fashion, events, or software, come from understanding what people truly need and delivering it with care.</p>

    <!-- Life Journey Narrative -->
    <section class="section">
      <div class="container">
        <div class="narrative-content">
          <p>My path has been anything but linear. I've helped people find the perfect fit as a personal stylist, coordinated unforgettable experiences as an event planner, and even brought stories to life as a voice actor. Along the way, I've been a swim instructor teaching kids confidence in the water, a photographer capturing moments that matter, and a DJ reading the room to keep energy flowing. Each of these experiences taught me something essential: the best outcomes come from paying attention, adapting quickly, and caring deeply about the people you're serving.</p>

          <p>What ties it all together is a fundamental belief that users deserve better. Whether I'm designing a garment alteration service, planning a corporate event, or building a developer platform, I'm always asking the same questions. What does this person actually need? What's getting in their way? How can I make this smoother, clearer, more intuitive? This curiosity led me to product design, where I found a home for my systems thinking, empathy, and love of solving complex problems.</p>

          <p>Today, I focus on developer experience and platform design. These are spaces where clarity, trust, and speed are non-negotiable. I bring the same attention to craft that I learned styling clients, the same orchestration skills from event planning, and the same adaptability from every role I've held. I don't just design interfaces. I design the experience of getting work done, making tools that feel like they're on your side.</p>
