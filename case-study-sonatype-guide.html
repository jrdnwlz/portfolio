      <h2>tl;dr</h2>
      <p>This project achieved a triptych of goals: to release a developer-first tool that <em>actually</em> helps developers; to create a new design system that can be adapted by existing SKUs; and spearhead a new, AI-assisted PDLC for rapid go-to-market release. Honestly, it was a dream assignment.</p>

      <p>
        For this project, I designed entirely in VS Code and used AI to accelerate ideation, iteration, and testing.
        Instead of relying on a mocked prototype for interpretation, I designed and built a working product environment.
        That artifact, the UX Lab, could be evaluated immediately and intimately by leadership, sales, and engineering teams alike.

      <h3>Define and design a new product offering for warp-speed GTM release</h3>
      <p>
        Sonatype needed a way to create a new SKU without relying on static design artifacts, elongated timelines, and design-to-dev translation errors.
        The goal was to craft and validate workflows, edge cases, and feasibility early, while also creating a working example to plan and develop from.</p>

      <h2>My Role</h2>
      <p class="lead">I'm fortunate to have been selected as the <strong>lead designer for Guide and the UX Lab</strong> project, invited to work closely with Product leadership and executives on a daily basis. My role in each discussion was to act as a champion for the developer-user, tapping into all that I've learned and heard from them over the years.</p> 
        <p>In the early stages, I collaborated with our small team to define the scope, goals, and success metrics for the initiative. 
        Orbiting the UX around specific workflows, I (and Claude Code) began building out pages, components, and patterns directly in VS Code. As the project progressed, I was responsible for aligning our UX Lab with any recent decisions or pivots, keeping our live artifact up to date.
        I later worked closely with engineering during the build phase to ensure a smooth handoff, and was ultimately asked to join the development effort myself.</p>

      <h2>Impact & Results</h2>

      <h3 style="margin-top: 24px">Product & Organizational Impact</h3>
      <ul class="stack">
        <li><strong>Shared product language</strong> Established a consistent visual and interaction system intended for adoption beyond the prototype.</li>
        <li><strong>Faster delivery</strong> Designing directly in production code reduced rework and shortened the path from concept to implementation.</li>
        <li><strong>Stakeholder confidence</strong> A working prototype helped leadership, sales, and engineering evaluate product behavior early.</li>
        <li><strong>Reduced product risk</strong> Workflows and edge cases were validated before committing to full-scale engineering.</li>
        <li><strong>Process influence</strong> The Lab demonstrated a viable AI-assisted, code-first workflow that reduced handoff friction.</li>
      </ul>

      </div>

      <h3 style="margin-top: 32px">Design Decisions Validated in Production</h3>
      <ul class="stack">
        <li><strong>Accessibility</strong> WCAG 2.1 AA behavior was validated during design, including keyboard navigation and ARIA labeling.</li>
        <li><strong>Performance</strong> Streaming, lazy loading, and code splitting were exercised under production-like conditions.</li>
        <li><strong>Responsiveness</strong> Mobile-first layouts and responsive behavior were validated across features and states.</li>
        <li><strong>Reliability</strong> Strict TypeScript surfaced edge cases early and improved confidence in component behavior.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Reflections & What This Changed</h2>

      <h3 style="margin-top: 24px">What Worked Well</h3>
      <ul class="stack">
        <li><strong>Design as a living artifact</strong> Because the prototype was the product environment, there was less drift between intent and implementation.</li>
        <li><strong>Accessibility-first foundations</strong> Starting with accessible primitives kept inclusive behavior as a default, not a retrofit.</li>
        <li><strong>Type safety as a design tool</strong> Strict typing revealed edge cases early and improved component reliability.</li>
        <li><strong>Real data improved realism</strong> Using actual CVEs and dependency data surfaced usability problems that mock content would have hidden.</li>
        <li><strong>Progressive composition</strong> Building components in isolation before composition reduced complexity and prevented cascading issues.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 style="margin-top: 24px">Design & Engineering Standards Established</h3>
      <ul class="stack">
        <li>Default to accessible primitives and keyboard-first interactions.</li>
        <li>Standardize iconography to support consistency and performance.</li>
        <li>Use mobile-first layout patterns across components and flows.</li>
        <li>Export TypeScript interfaces for component APIs to support reuse and safety.</li>
        <li>Handle empty, null, and error states explicitly to reduce hidden failures.</li>
        <li>Use semantic design tokens to support theming and future adoption.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 style="margin-top: 24px">What I'd Do Next</h3>
      <p class="muted">
        Extract the component library into a shared package, add interactive documentation (Storybook or similar),
        implement visual regression testing, and align design tokens between code and Figma.
        The goal would be faster adoption across products with lower maintenance cost.
