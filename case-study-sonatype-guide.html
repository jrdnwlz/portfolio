      <h2>What Changed</h2>
      <p>
        Before Guide UX Lab, Sonatype's design process leaned on static wireframes and Figma prototypes.
        That approach worked for exploration, but it often created translation gaps during engineering handoff.
        It also limited confidence when evaluating feasibility for a new product SKU.
      </p>

      <p>
        For this project, I designed entirely in VS Code and used AI to accelerate ideation and iteration.
        Instead of handing off a prototype for interpretation, I built a working product environment.
        That artifact could be evaluated immediately by leadership, sales, and engineering.

      <h2>The Challenge</h2>
      <p>
        Sonatype needed a way to explore a new product SKU without relying on speculative design artifacts.
        The goal was to validate workflows, edge cases, and feasibility early, while also establishing a UI foundation
        that could be adopted across existing products.
      </p>
      <ul class="stack">
        <li><strong>Establish consistency</strong>Create UI and interaction patterns that could scale beyond a single prototype and migrate to existing Sonatype products.</li>
        <li><strong>Reduce product risk</strong> Validate workflows and edge cases in a realistic environment before committing to full engineering implementation.</li>
        <li><strong>Accelerate delivery</strong> Reduce rework by designing directly against production constraints, including accessibility and performance.</li>
        <li><strong>Set a new design standard</strong> Demonstrate an AI-assisted, code-first approach that reduced handoff friction and improved alignment.</li>
        <li><strong>Support long-term evolution</strong> Build a living system that could evolve alongside the product, not a one-off prototype.</li>

      <h2>Designing a Migratable System in Code</h2>

      <p>
        I designed the system directly in code and structured it to support real product workflows, not isolated UI elements.

      <h3 style="margin-top: 24px">What Worked Well</h3>
      <ul class="stack">
        <li><strong>Design as a living artifact</strong> Because the prototype was the product environment, there was less drift between intent and implementation.</li>
        <li><strong>Accessibility-first foundations</strong> Starting with accessible primitives kept inclusive behavior as a default, not a retrofit.</li>
        <li><strong>Type safety as a design tool</strong> Strict typing revealed edge cases early and improved component reliability.</li>
        <li><strong>Real data improved realism</strong> Using actual CVEs and dependency data surfaced usability problems that mock content would have hidden.</li>
        <li><strong>Progressive composition</strong> Building components in isolation before composition reduced complexity and prevented cascading issues.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 style="margin-top: 24px">Design & Engineering Standards Established</h3>
      <ul class="stack">
        <li>Default to accessible primitives and keyboard-first interactions.</li>
        <li>Standardize iconography to support consistency and performance.</li>
        <li>Use mobile-first layout patterns across components and flows.</li>
        <li>Export TypeScript interfaces for component APIs to support reuse and safety.</li>

      <h3 style="margin-top: 24px">What I'd Do Next</h3>
      <p class="muted">
        Extract the component library into a shared package, add interactive documentation (Storybook or similar),
        implement visual regression testing, and align design tokens between code and Figma.
        The goal would be faster adoption across products with lower maintenance cost.
